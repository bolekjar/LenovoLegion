Unofficial control application for Legion Pro 7 16IRX9H with Coreâ„¢ i9-14900HX and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU.


This project is not affiliated with Lenovo in any way
Lenovo Legion brings additional drivers and tools for Legion Pro 7 16IRX9H with Coreâ„¢ i9-14900HX and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU to Linux. It is the alternative to Lenovo Vantage or Legion Zone (both Windows only).
It allows you to control features like the fan curve, power mode, power limits,  and more. This has been achieved through reverse engineering and disassembling the ACPI firmware, as well as the firmware and memory of the embedded controller (EC).
